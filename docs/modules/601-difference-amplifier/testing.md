# Testing


## Equipment Required

- Oscilloscope.
- Waveform generator.
- 2x BNC to 3.5mm patch cables.
- Multimeter with probes.
- Power supply capable of providing 12V DC @ 100mA.

## Before You Begin

- Configure your power supply to provide 12 volts to a 2.1mm DC barrel connector.
- Set power supply over current protection to 100mA.
- Connect power to the device.

## Functional Tests

## Performance Tests

### Test +3.3V rail accuracy

- Use your multimeter to measure the voltage present at pin 3 of the U3 DC-DC converter module.
- Verify that the measurement is within the range of 3.0V to 3.6V.

### Test +2.75V rail accuracy
### Test -2.75V power rail accuracy
### Test reference voltage
